# GlassWallet
 Virtual machine that emulates a multi-chain cold Wallet, developed with the purpose of integrating navigation and transactions within an autonomous system, avoiding any type of risk or hacking to the accounts that are managed. The environment has three working modes, first a virtualized machine (recommended method) that will allow you to take your wallets to any operating system that supports VirtualBOX technology, second a real mode that will allow you to manage wallets in real time within your browser from the chrome family as an add-on, this option is only indicated for low power computers and its limited use is recommended since the security features of the virtual console are lost. And third, the mobile option (in development) that will allow to have a virtual instance of the wallet, maintaining the security of its PC version within Android cell phones only.
