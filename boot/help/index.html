	<h2>What is this ?</h2>
	<p>Glass Program Manager is a virtual machine designed to emulate a multi-chain cold wallet. Its main purpose is to integrate browsing and transactions within a self-contained system, effectively mitigating any risks or hacking attempts on managed accounts. The program offers three operational modes. The recommended method is a virtualized machine, which enables users to access their wallets on any operating system supporting VirtualBox technology. The second mode is a real-time option, allowing wallet management directly within a Chrome-family browser as an add-on. This mode is recommended for low-power computers, but it comes with limited usage as it compromises some security features of the virtual console. Lastly, a mobile option is currently under development, which will provide a virtual wallet instance maintaining the same security standards as the PC version, exclusively for Android smartphones.</p>	
	<h2>Why was this created ?</h2>
	<p> The idea of the wallet manager arose from the limitations we encountered when trying to protect our electronic wallets, and the fact that we couldn't have everything in a single browser while ensuring protection against possible hacks or capital loss. That's why we decided to create this addon and a browser that would unite all the wallets into a single application, while allowing each wallet to be updated without jeopardizing the capital. This way, we achieve a quasi-cold wallet where we can store our capital or simply perform investment actions quickly and securely. And above all, we have everything in one place, being able to access it from our computer regardless of the operating system, or from a TV box or even from a mobile phone.</p>
	<h2>How to use?</h2>
	<p>Glass works simply, by default using the Venom network. Although it is an L2 layer and is in testing, it allows you to test the network and safeguard your funds through a cold storage system. To access your funds, simply click on the wallet located at the bottom left of the application menu. You can create a new wallet or import an existing one. Now, from the crypto menu (accessed by clicking the crypto button), you can install other wallets and import their contents to keep them secure. However, we always recommend creating new wallets that will be used within the manager's interface. Within the application, you will find different areas of applications where you can edit or create documents, accessing Windows and Javascript software without the need for a computer. You will also have quick calculation utilities (often necessary for crypto asset holdings calculations) and even access to a completely free retro gaming section, as well as paid services like Xbox Cloud that have been adapted for keyboard and mouse use. Additionally, you will have access to both paid and free streaming services. The goal is to have everything integrated into a secure system where you can keep your credentials protected.</p>
	<h2>Comparing Ethereum vs. Venom architectures</h2>
	<p>Chances are, you have some familiarity with EVM-based blockchains such as Ethereum, and now you find yourself in a situation where you need to transition your expertise to Venom, a different blockchain network. This article aims to highlight key distinctions between these two networks, providing valuable insights for your migration process.</p>
	<h2>EVM as the "Global Computer" vs. TVM with the Dynamic Sharding protocol</h2>
	<p>The Venom blockchain offers a different approach to virtual machines compared to EVM. While EVM functions as a global computer with concurrency challenges, Venom operates like a multicore system with distributed computing capabilities. By utilizing dynamic sharding, Venom can assign tasks to different validator task groups, enabling scalability and asynchronous interactions between participants. This eliminates the need for sequential execution and improves efficiency. For more details on the architecture of the Venom blockchain, please refer to the provided link.</p>
	<h2>Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Communication</h2>
	<p>One important difference between TVM-based and EVM-based networks is how accounts (smart contracts) communicate. In EVM-based networks, transactions are executed one by one, relying on the completion of previous transactions, even if they access different account states. This synchronous execution can be slower. On the other hand, TVM-based networks have an asynchronous communication model, allowing accounts to send messages to each other. Each account processes only the messages addressed to it, making transaction processing more efficient and enabling parallel processing of multiple transactions, leading to faster transaction speeds.</p>	
	<h2>Gas Model and Fees</h2>
	<p>In Ethereum, transactions are limited by the gas model, where users pay fees in Ether (ETH) based on the amount of gas used. In Venom, fees are calculated considering gas, data storage, and forward message fees. Users can decide the amount of VENOM to attach as payment fees from their contract account, setting an upper limit for the call execution cost. By including data storage fees, Venom promotes efficient storage usage and encourages contract designs that minimize storage. This helps prevent long-term network congestion.</p>	
	<h2>Licenses</h2>
	<p>All the content presented within the application is free, without monetary charges, and it is free to distribute.</p>
